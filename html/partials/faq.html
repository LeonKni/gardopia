                    <li>Most fruits and vegetables prefer full sunlight, and require 6 – 8 hours to produce a worthwhile
                        yield. Try to find a spot that receives morning and afternoon sun.

                    <li>
                        Try to use a soil that specifically is made for fruits and vegetables, rose soil can work as
                        well. Too much clay in the soil will retain water, and soil that is too loose will not hold
                        enough moisture…therefore a medium soil that is a mixture of clay/sand/compost is best.

                    When do I plant?

                    <li>
                        There are many seasons within a year, but a three plot rotation is best. You can plant many
                        green leafy vegetables (i.e. broccoli, spinach, swiss chards, etc.) in the fall and winter. In
                        the spring and summer you can plant another plot with more of the water retaining fruits
                        (tomatoes, squash, peppers, eggplant, etc.). The third plot will always be fallow, allowing for
                        the soil to rest; you can also fertilize the fallow plot to replace nutrients that have been
                        depleted by the plants.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        As stated above, different plants are utilized in each season. In the fall/winter vegetables are
                        common (no seeds), and in the spring/summer fruits are more appropriate. <br><a

                    How often do I water?
                </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Depending upon the temperature, watering frequency will differ. In the fall/winter you should
                        water every 1 – 2 days. In the spring summer you can possibly water every day. This will really
                        be dependent upon soil type and temperature. You want your soil to be moist, not dry or
                        waterlogged. Use mulch to help retain water in the summer, and insulate roots in the winter.

                    What fertilizers do I use?

                    <li>
                        You can use synthetic or natural fertilizers. Since my gardens are organic, I suggest you save
                        your food scraps from the kitchen, and start a compost bin. To supplement your compost, you can
                        use a mixture of liquid seaweed, molasses, and a fish emulsifier (root feeding is recommended).

                    <li>
                        Optimally you can fertilize every 10 days. At minimum you should fertilize once a month.

                    <li>
                        I highly recommend that you try organic gardening, the less synthetic chemicals the more natural
                        your homegrown fruits and vegetables.

                        Some bugs/insects are beneficial (ladybugs, worms, spiders, etc.) and others are detrimental

                    What about Herbicides and Pesticides?

                    <li>
                        Weeds and detrimental insects are a gardener’s worst enemy. In order to mitigate this problem
                        always use trusted sources for soil and plants. Constantly weeding and using mulch will help
                        with the weeds. For insect problems try using beneficial insects and complimentary planting
                        (i.e. tomatoes with basil) before moving to a pesticide; Organic pesticides are always
                        preferred!
